# cordova-plugin-badge (fork)

This is a fork of `cordova-plugin-file-badge` by [Moodle HQ](https://moodle.com/). If you are looking for the documentation, you can read the original at [katzer/cordova-plugin-badge](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-badge).

## Modifications from the original

We created this fork because the fix to replace compile with implementation in gradle file wasn't published in npm.

## Installation

You can install this package using the [original installation instructions](https://github.com/katzer/cordova-plugin-badge#installation), but installing this package instead:

```sh
cordova plugin add @moodlehq/cordova-plugin-badge@0.8.8-moodle.1
```
